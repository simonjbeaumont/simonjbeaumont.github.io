  try! Swift Tokyo: Building a streaming ChatGPT proxy with Swift OpenAPI
summary: |
  Join us as we build a ChatGPT client, from scratch, using Swift OpenAPI
  Generator. We'll take advantage of Swift OpenAPI's pluggable HTTP transports
  to reuse the same generated client to make upstream calls from a Linux
  server, providing end-to-end streaming, backed by async sequences, without
  buffering upstream responses.
