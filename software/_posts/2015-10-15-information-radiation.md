Like woolly socks for your brain, you almost feel warmer inside when you stare
at an information radiator. There's something about capturing the information
that can bring a sense of calm. Even if the information paints a bad picture,
at least it's a picture you can see! You have reduced your _known-unknowns_.

Last year, our company made the move to _Agile_. The very word will conjure
a variety of images for different people. For me, this sums it up:

![estimates-as-deadlines](/images/information-radiator/estimates-as-deadlines.jpg)

But that aside, one of the pillars of _Agile_ is about refining commitment and
to do this you need to measure all the things. A vital part of understanding
your throughput (or _velocity_) is having past information to hand. As a team
I think it's fair to say that our methods were a touch lo-Fi:

Yes, that is some scribblings on a whiteboard. However, it wasn't the _Art
Attack_ nature of it that caused us to rethink; it was the fact that we have
a cross-geo team. Short of setting up a permanent webcam a la the infamous
[Trojan Room coffee pot][1], our colleagues in India were not going to feel any
the warmer for _this_ information radiator.

# Out with the old 'n' busted; in with the new shiny

We have now replaced _Scribbles on a whiteboard_ with an interactive,
browser-based, dashboard:

What you display is up to you, but we want to focus as a team on reducing two
metrics: the number of open tickets and the number of open pull requests.

Now we have these numbers glowering at us every time we stand up from our desks
on a 42" screen hanging from the ceiling. But, and just as importantly for our
cross-geo colleagues, this dashboard can be accessed from anywhere on our
intranet and displayed in a browser.

It's a major win over _Scribbles_ since it's also quite interactive. If you
hover over a section of a graph it will break down the points for you (as you
can see in the bottom part of the screenshot). It's also set up so that you can
click on one of the numbers and it will take you to JIRA or Github for the open
ticket numbers and pull requests respectively.

## How does it all fit together?

The infrastructure for this dashboard is pretty simple. We basically have
a [NUC][2] (think Raspberry Pi) running Fedora strapped to the back of a TV
which runs the following:

* [Some scripts][5] to get the numbers;
* [InfluxDB][3] to store the numbers;
* [Grafana][4] to visualise the numbers in a feature-rich dashboard;
* Firefox in fullscreen mode to show the dashboard.

## InfluxDB

InfluxDB is an open-source (✓), schema-less (✓), locally-hosted (✓), time-series
database. It just **worked out of the box** after installation. They have
packages for many distributions on their [download page][6] including for Mac.
For us, installation was as simple as:

```sh
$ wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/influxdb/influxdb-0.9.4.2-1.x86_64.rpm
$ sudo yum localinstall influxdb-0.9.4.2-1.x86_64.rpm
$ sudo chkconfig influxdb on
$ sudo service influxdb start
```

Now we have the `influxd` daemon running. We can start throwing data at it.
Here we create a separate database, but you could just as easily use the
default one. Then we just write the data we want to store---no need for
a schema, it's more of a JFDI database:

```sh
$ /opt/influxdb/influx
Connected to http://localhost:8086 version 0.9.4.1
InfluxDB shell 0.9.4.1
> CREATE database test
> USE test
Using database test
> INSERT cpu,host=serverA,region=us_west value=0.64
> SELECT * FROM cpu
name: cpu
---------
time                            host    region  value
2015-10-13T14:49:15.533599835Z  serverA us_west 0.64
```

It's that simple. Queries are made made using InfluxQL which is
straight-forward. InfluxDB's [Getting Started][7] page is good place to start.
They also draw up a [comparison to SQL][8] for those with an SQL background.

It also configures a web interface out of the box so you can make queries by
going to `localhost:8083` in your browser and, more importantly for us, it
exposes an [API][9] over HTTP on port 8086 which we'll use to record data from
our scripts.

## Scripts to write to the database

Getting the data you want is up to you. Being an open-source project, one of
the things we wanted to record was the number of open pull requests to the
repositories we maintain as a team. To do this we wrote a [python script][10]
to find this information using [Github's REST API][11]. Once we had our data
that we wanted to record it was a simple `HTTP POST` to put the data into
InfluxDB:

```python
influx_uri = "http://localhost:8086/write?db=inforad"
tstamp = int(time.time()) * 10**9
try:
    for (repo, count) in counts.iteritems():
        data = "open_pull_requests,repo=%s value=%d %d" % (repo, count,
                                                            tstamp)
        resp = requests.post(influx_uri, data=data)
    data = "total_open_pull_requests value=%d" % len(pull_reqs)
    requests.post(influx_uri, data=data)
except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError:
    sys.stderr.write("error: Connection to local influxdb failed")
    sys.exit(5)
```

## Configuring Grafana

Once Grafana is installed, there isn't much configuration to do. By default it
binds to port 3000 but this can be changed either by changing the `http_port`
option in `/etc/grafana/grafana.ini` or by forwarding all requests on port 80
to port 3000:

```sh
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 3000
```

Grafana supports authenticated access and is configured with basic auth out of
the box. It also has support for LDAP but we wanted to disable all
authentication since it is only running internally. To do this, just un-comment
the option in the config file:

```diff
 [auth.anonymous]
 # enable anonymous access
-;enabled = true
+enabled = true
```

Next you'll need to add the local InfluxDB as a datasource from which you can
query in Grafana:

Then it's just a question of adding graphs using Grafana's web interface. It
echos the query language that you'd use in directly with InfluxDB:

And there you go... "Job's a good'n" as they say:
