So I recently decided I'd try my hand at building my own guitar pedal. It went
pretty well and I'm really impressed with it. It really is as amazing-sounding
and versatile as they claim. Flippin' amazing!

It's based on the vintage TS-808 Tubescreamer for it's main overdrive circuit
but has incorporated <strike>many</strike> tons of the mods that people made to
them back in the day. 

For those interested in how it sounds. Check out <a target="_blank"

Jack Black? --- who knows?!)...

For those of you nerds who don't care too much for sound but can't resist a
good ol' geek-fest and want to buy one and have a crack at it check the <a

website</a>.

There are a few things I __love__ about this pedal. It's just so darn
**_customisable_**. For instance:

* The **IC is socketted** and the kit comes with 2 ICs:
   * A Burr Brown OPA2134 for a real boutique tone
   * A JRC4558D for the authentic TS-808 tone

* A second **boost channel** that can either be build silicon-based or
MOSFET-based

* **3-way clipping switch** for the main OD channel:
    * Silicon clipping
    * LED clipping
    * No clipping - let you sweet-ass valve amp do all the hard work :)

* **3-way EQ switch** for full, fat, or normal tone

  They even use trimpots in the circuitry for the tone-critical components
rather than standard resistors so you can tweak the parameters for the TS
circuit

* It's **true-bypass** --- for all those who like to keep their tone pure ;)

## So... let the journey commence.

Ah yes, every project must start with the standard stock-check!

## Conclusions

After all this did it work? Well, no.

Well, kind of. It worked but only with the 9V battery and not the mains so a
bit of debugging and I fixed it.

So basically - after much burning of fingers and inhalation of solder fumes I
know have this pedal! I have to say it is amazing and is kinda making me a
little upset about how much I may have spent on it's neighbour whom it's now
putting to shame. Whole hartedly recommend doing this for anyone who satisfies
the following criteria.

* You actually want a sweet boutique pedal but can't cough up big _**$$**_

* You can get your hands on a decent soldering iron, snips &amp; FLUX(!)

* You have some patience and some vague competence

All in all, it's been a fun experience and one that I will definitely try
again.
